Do not forget:

1st check the convention of the position gradients and forces (correct signs)
-> look at convert.py and the ForceResponse class

2nd check the type hints for torch modules

3rd Implement Transformer that removes composition energy
    and acts on TensorMap

4th adapt the ase_to_tensormap for the extraction of the targets, 
such that it actually comes in torch.Tensors and no conversion is necessary
