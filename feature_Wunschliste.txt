transformers:
have gobal transformers
- using any of the rascaline features



uncertainty estimates:
NLL_loss, CPRS_loss
ensemble-trainer and ensemble-gatherer (for deep-ens, MVE_model or Mean_only model)

training scheduler:
for NLL ensembles.
have a training routine (1st 100 epochs mse train then slowly NLL weight increase)

active learning loop:
in the driver the model predicts uncertainty, if sigma > tresh.
the model instead of doing a step launches a calculator, recalculates the step, refits the potential
and attempts to do the step again.
