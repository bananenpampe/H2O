# 1st test. A model should yield exactly twice the energy if the unit cell is doubled

# 2nd test. A model should yield exactly the same energy if the unit cell is rotated

# 3rd test. A model should yield exactly the same energy if the unit cell is rotated and translated

# 4th test. A model should yield exactly the same energy if the unit cell is rotated and translated and the atoms are shuffled

# 5th test. A model should yield exactly the twice energy if the unit cell is rotated and translated and the atoms are shuffled and the cell is doubled

# 6th show consisentcy for multiplication of n*times the unit cell
